# Checkers Game with Minimax Algorithm

This repository contains a Checkers game implemented in C++ using the minimax algorithm for AI. The game features a graphical interface built with `graphics.h`.

## Features

- Human vs Human mode
- Human vs Computer mode
    - AI with minimax algorithm for strategic moves

## Requirements

- C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, TDM-GCC-32)
- `graphics.h` library

## Installation

### Windows

1. **Install `graphics.h` Library:**
   Follow specific steps to install `graphics.h` for your compiler. For example, if you are using Code::Blocks with MinGW, you can follow [this guide](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/include-graphics-h-codeblocks/).

2. **Clone the Repository:**
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/checkers-minimax.git
